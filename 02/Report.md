Project 2 <br>
Due: 10-16-2023 <br>

Lab Report <br>

1.) File: orig.cpp <br>
No changes. I waited around 45 minutes but it never finished. <br>
Time: N/A <br>
Speedup: N/A <br>


2.) File: Test1.cpp <br>
Following the lecture slides from 'Class 12 - Load Balancing' I Implented threads <br>
to speed up this program. <br>
Time: 1m57.25s or 117.25s <br>
Speedup: N/A <br>

3.) File: Test2.cpp <br>
Rewrote the for loop on line 42 to be a more effiect while loop that doesn't redo operations <br>
Time: 1m14.87 or 74.87s <br>
Speedup: 1.58x <br>

4.) File: Test3.cpp<br>
Following the lecture slides from 'Class 8 - Introduction to Threads' I implemented the most basic threads I could come up with <br>
Time: 1m18.084s or 78.084s <br>
Speedup: 1.5x <br>
<br>

Note: Since i couldnt get the orignal program to finish my Speedup calcustions are based off the speed of 2 (Test1.cpp).
